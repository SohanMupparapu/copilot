      "scenarios": "### Test Scenarios for Transaction Notification Requirement\n\n#### 1. Positive / Happy Path\n- **TP-1**: Successful transaction above \u20b95000 triggers an email notification to the user.\n- **TP-2**: Successful transaction above \u20b95000 triggers an SMS notification to the user.\n- **TP-3**: Transaction exactly at \u20b95000 does not trigger a notification to verify the threshold.\n- **TP-4**: Multiple transactions above \u20b95000 in a short timeframe correctly send multiple notifications.\n- **TP-5**: Transaction notification includes all necessary details (transaction amount, date, type, etc.).\n- **TP-6**: User receives notification for a transaction that is partially above \u20b95000 (e.g., \u20b95001).\n\n#### 2. Negative / Edge Cases\n- **NE-1**: Transaction below \u20b95000 does not trigger any notification.\n- **NE-2**: Transaction of exactly \u20b95000 does not trigger a notification to test the threshold.\n- **NE-3**: Non-numeric or invalid transaction amount does not trigger a notification.\n- **NE-4**: Transaction with a negative amount does not trigger a notification.\n- **NE-5**: Zero-value transaction does not trigger a notification.\n- **NE-6**: Test with different currencies to ensure the system only considers transactions in the specified currency (INR).\n- **NE-7**: Test with a transaction amount that, when converted to INR, exceeds \u20b95000 to ensure correct handling of multi-currency transactions.\n\n#### 3. Error & Exception Handling\n- **EE-1**: System handles network errors during notification sending (e.g., email/SMS service downtime).\n- **EE-2**: System behavior when user's email/SMS details are incorrect or missing.\n- **EE-3**: Handling of exceptions during transaction processing that might affect notification (e.g., database errors).\n- **EE-4**: System response to a failed notification attempt (retry mechanism, logging, etc.).\n- **EE-5**: Error handling for cases where the transaction amount cannot be determined or is ambiguous.\n\n#### 4. Security & Performance Considerations\n- **SP-1**: Notification system is secure against unauthorized access to user transaction data.\n- **SP-2**: Performance impact of sending notifications for a large volume of transactions.\n- **SP-3**: System's ability to handle concurrent transactions and notifications without significant delay.\n- **SP-4**: Compliance with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when sending notifications.\n- **SP-5**: Security measures in place to prevent spam or phishing attempts through the notification system.\n- **SP-6**: Load testing to ensure the system can handle peak transaction volumes without failing to send notifications.\n- **SP-7**: Penetration testing to identify and fix any vulnerabilities in the notification system."
